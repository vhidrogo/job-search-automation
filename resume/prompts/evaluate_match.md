## Input

**Requirement Keywords:**
{{REQUIREMENTS}}

**Skill Keywords:**
{{SKILLS}}

---

## Instructions

Compare the requirement keywords against the skill keywords and identify which requirements are not covered.

Return JSON with this structure:
```json
{
  "unmet_requirements": "<comma-separated list of unmet requirement keywords>",
  "match_ratio": <float between 0.0 and 1.0>
}
```

**Rules:**
1. A requirement is considered MET if it appears in the skill keywords (case-insensitive partial match)
2. A requirement is UNMET if it does not appear in the skill keywords
3. Calculate match_ratio as: (total requirements - unmet count) / total requirements
4. If all requirements are met, unmet_requirements should be an empty string ""
5. Return valid JSON only, no extra text
6. Round match_ratio to 2 decimal places

**Example:**
- Total requirements: 5
- Unmet requirements: 2
- match_ratio: (5 - 2) / 5 = 0.60
